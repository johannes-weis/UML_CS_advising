<li>12 credits from courses offered by any academic department within
the University as general electives.</li>
<li>However, CS students must <strong>avoid:</strong>

<li>courses in areas required by the CS curriculum (mathematics and
physics) unless they are at a level higher than the courses required by
the CS curriculum</li>
<li>non-CS courses having a significant computing component or a
significant overlap in content with courses required by the CS
curriculum</li>
<li>CS courses for non-majors</li>
<li>Examples of courses that may <strong>not</strong> be used as general
electives are
<ul>
<li>Programming language courses offered by other departments such as <a
href="https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/MATH/2720"
target="_blank">MATH.2720</a> or <a
href="https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/INFO/2030"
target="_blank">INFO.2030</a></li>
<li>MIS or IT courses</li>
<li>Math courses below the level of the science and engineering calculus
sequence</li>
<li>CS courses for non-majors</li>
<li>Many certificate courses (including some Computer Science Department
courses) offered through Continuing Education such as <a
