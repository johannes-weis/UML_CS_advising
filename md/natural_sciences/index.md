# Courses that Satisfy the Computer Science Natural Science Elective Requirement

Students must pass at least 12 credits of approved natural science courses (see below for lists of approved courses). Two 3-credit natural science courses must be taken with their companion 1-credit labs. The remaining 4 credits can be satisfied **either**

- by taking a third 3-credit natural science course with its companion 1-credit lab, **or**
- by taking two 3-credit natural science courses without their companion labs.

**However, the Computer Science faculty recommends that students always take the companion lab for any natural science course when a lab is available.**

Natural science electives must come from one of the four natural science departments in the College of Sciences. These are:

- Biological Sciences
- Chemistry
- Environmental, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences
- Physics and Applied Physics

The courses in these departments that fulfill the CS natural science elective requirement are those that are classified as either **required or elective courses for the majors in the respective departments.** In general, **courses that satisfy GenEd technical elective requirements for non-science majors do not satisfy the CS natural science elective requirement.** Such unallowed courses are ones whose University catalog descriptions contain the statement: “This course satisfies the GenEd science requirement, but not specific science requirements for majors in the Division of Science.” However, there are some exceptions. See the specific course recommendations below.

>
> **Note:** BIOL.1110 and BIOL.1120 Principles of Biology I and II are required for Biology majors and should be taken by students with a serious interest in Biology. Otherwise, students should take Life Sciences I and II. No students should take both the Principles of Biology and Life Sciences courses.

<!-- The general option for CS requires four CS electives.  The completion of these four CS electives must include a project sequence.  Project sequences are most often two courses, but in the case of Compiler Design, only one course is needed to complete the project sequence.
<br>
<br>
For all students with a single major in CS, four CS electives are required.  Some double majors with CS have fewer required CS electives, but must still complete a project sequence.  Dual CS/Math majors require three CS electives, while dual CS/EE majors require only two.
