# Courses that Satisfy the Computer Science Natural Science Elective Requirement

<br>

Students must pass at least 12 credits of approved natural science courses
(see below for lists of approved courses). Two 3-credit natural science courses
must be taken with their companion 1-credit labs. The remaining 4 credits can
be satisfied **either:**

- by taking a third 3-credit natural science course with its companion 1-credit
  lab, **or**
- by taking two 3-credit natural science courses without their companion labs.

**However, the Computer Science faculty recommends that students always take the
companion lab for any natural science course when a lab is available.**

<br>

Natural science electives must come from one of the four natural science
departments in the College of Sciences. These are:

- Biological Sciences
- Chemistry
- Environmental, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences
- Physics and Applied Physics

**Students can only take a maximum of two courses with labs from the same
department.**

<br>

The courses in these departments that fulfill the CS natural science elective
requirement are those that are classified as either **required or elective
courses for the majors in the respective departments.** In general, **courses
that satisfy GenEd technical elective requirements for non-science majors do
not satisfy the CS natural science elective requirement.** Such unallowed
courses are ones whose University catalog descriptions contain the
statement: “This course satisfies the GenEd science requirement, but not
specific science requirements for majors in the Division of Science.” However,
there are some exceptions. See the specific course recommendations below.
