<br>

## University GenEd Requirements

- A student has to take **three AH and three SS** GenEd courses, but **not more than two courses from the same department**
- [ENGL.2200](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/ENGL/2200){target="_blank"} is a required AH GenEd
- At least one course from the [SRE (Social Responsibility & Ethics)](https://www.uml.edu/Catalog/Undergraduate/Core-Curriculum/ELO/Course-Listing-SRE.aspx){target="_blank"} listing is required as a GenEd
- At least one course from the [DCA (Diversity & Cultural Awareness)](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/undergraduate/core-curriculum/elo/course-listing-dca.aspx){target="_blank"} listing is required as a GenEd

## Technical Electives

- **6 credits** from courses offered by the College of Sciences (including CS) or the College of Engineering.
- Courses that fulfill this requirement must be classified as required or elective courses for the majors in those departments.
- In general, Information Technology courses such as [INFO.1600](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/INFO/1600){target="_blank"} may **not** be used to fulfill this requirement.
- Specific courses may be recommended for different minors (Math, Robotics, etc.).

## General (Free Electives)

- 12 credits from courses offered by any academic department within the University as general electives.
- However, CS students must **avoid:**
	- courses in areas required by the CS curriculum (mathematics and physics) unless they are at a level higher than the courses required by the CS curriculum
	- non-CS courses having a significant computing component or a significant overlap in content with courses required by the CS curriculum
	- CS courses for non-majors
	- Examples of courses that may **not** be used as general electives are
		- Programming language courses offered by other departments such as [MATH.2720](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/MATH/2720){target="_blank"} or [INFO.2030](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/INFO/2030){target="_blank"}
		- MIS or IT courses
		- Math courses below the level of the science and engineering calculus sequence
		- CS courses for non-majors
		- Many certificate courses (including some Computer Science Department courses) offered through Continuing Education such as [MSIT.5140](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/MSIT/5140){target="_blank"}
