title: Project Sequences for Computer Science at UMass Lowell

# Computer Science Project Sequences

The general option for CS requires four CS electives.  The completion of these four CS electives must include a project sequence.  Project sequences are most often two courses, but in the case of Compiler Design, only one course is needed to complete the project sequence.
<br>
<br>
For all students with a single major in CS, four CS electives are required.  Some double majors with CS have fewer required CS electives, but must still complete a project sequence.  Dual CS/Math majors require three CS electives, while dual CS/EE majors require only two.
