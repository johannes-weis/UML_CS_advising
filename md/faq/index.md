> ## Natural Science Electives
>

> - [BIOL.1110](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/BIOL/1110){target="_blank"} (Principles of Biology I (Formerly 81.111)) and [LIFE.1010](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/LIFE/1010){target="_blank"} (Life Science I (Formerly 83.101)) are **Anti-Requirement**.  You can take one but not both as credit.
> - [ENVI.2020](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/ENVI/2020){target="_blank"} (Earth Systems: Atmosphere and Oceans (Formerly 87.202)) and [ATMO.1410](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/ATMO/1410){target="_blank"} (ATMO.1410 Weather and Climate (Formerly 85.141)) are **Anti-Requirement**.

> - Known courses not allowed as elective include: 
> 	- [EECE.2160](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/EECE/2160){target="_blank"} (ECE Application Programming (Formerly 16.216)), content is similar to/lower than our Computing I
> 	- [EECE.3220](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/EECE/3220){target="_blank"} (Data Structures (Formerly 16.322)), content is similar to/lower than our Computing II
> 

> ## Transfer Credits 
> 
> - Written and Oral Communication [ENGL.2200](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/ENGL/2200){target="_blank"} : If you took [ENGL.2220](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/ENGL/2220){target="_blank"} at another school you can transfer it to [ENGL.2200](https://www.uml.edu/catalog/courses/ENGL/2200){target="_blank"}, otherwise please take the correct class.
> 

> ## Math Minor with a CS degree
> 
> - Requires 21 Math credits and the CS general option curriculum already has 17 Math credits. So yes, 4 more credits in Math (like Calculus III) is sufficient for a Math Minor.
> 
> [Please contact the [Math department](mailto:mathematics@uml.edu){target="_blank"} for more on this.]{.small}
